# relast

relast turns on "loop one" if the playlist starts playing
the last media item. The idea is that you have something playing
in the background and when you want to switch, whatever you add
gets to be played continuously until you add something else.

I know, it's trivial :P

Also, I'm a complete Lua noob so don't be surprised if this
is the worst code you've ever seen.
